# Translating Stata to R

The goal of this site is to provide a simple 'on-ramp' to R for Stata users.
There are two main pages (✌️📄) on this site:

1. Data wrangling (🗄🧹) with [**data.table**](/data.table/)
2. Regression analysis (💻📈) with [**fixest**](/fixest/)

There are [**other great packages**](/extras/) 
that work well and are easy to use, but **data.table** and **fixest** are 
blazingly fast (🏃🏻💨) and highly powerful (💪🏻😎).

Plus, they are flexible (👌✨) and can help you avoid R's "package overload".
Depending on what you do in Stata, you might even be able to cut back, going 
from three packages—**reghdfe**, **estout** and **gtools**—to just two.
